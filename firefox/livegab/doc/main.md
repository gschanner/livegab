Simple firefox addon that tries to open livestreamer for the currently opened page.

To do so, ensure that livestreamer is installed and its executable is in the PATH environment variable (http://livestreamer.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).
After the Add-on is installed, a button labeled "LG" is available in the browser toolbar.
When a page, containing a livestream, is currently open, pressing the button will start livestreamer with the current page as the first parameter and quality "best" as the second parameter.
